# Photo-Curves

A photo taken from a digital camera may sometimes appear too dull or too bright. This is a situation where we could use a photo curve for photo post-processing to make our photos look dramatically better. Applying a curve to a photo can be thought of as a way of remapping an image's tonality, enabling us to adjust the brightness, increase contrast, or emphasize colors.
